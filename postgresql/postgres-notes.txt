CREATE TABLE table-name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY 
    col2 INTEGER REFERENCES another-table(column-name) FOREIGN-KEY-CONSTRAINT
)

SERIAL          -- is to generate the integer automatically when ever a new record is being inserted into the table 
PRIMARY KEY     -- Creates a primary key index and constraint on the column id
REFERENCES      -- Creates a foreign key constraint and index on the column 'column-name' of the table 'another-table'

FOREIGN-KEY-CONSTRAINT: 
1. ON DELETE RESTRICT       - Default Option - Throws an error when the root row is deleted
2. ON DELETE NO ACTION      - Throws an error
3. ON DELETE CASCADE        - Deletes all the rows from the referencing table
4. ON DELETE SET NULL       - Updates with the NULL value
5. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT    - Updates with the default value set on the column

Group By
You can use JOIN ON condition when using GROUP BY clause. 

Aggregate Functions
MIN()
MAX()
SUM()
COUNT()
AVG()

WHERE    - filters on set of rows
HAVING   - filters on set of groups  So HAVING will always be preceded with GROUP BY 

WHERE AND HAVING can be combined
Ex: SELECT A, B,C FROM TABLE1 WHERE CONDITION GROUP BY COLUMN HAVING CONDITION

SORTING:
ASC     - Default
DESC    - 
Note: You can sort on multiple columns 
Ex:  SELECT * FROM TABLE ORDER BY COL1 ASC COL2 DESC
Here all the records will be sorted in ascending order based on column1 and when column1 values are same then all those 
records will be sorted based on column2 in descending order. 

UNION           -- Combines the values. and duplicates will be removed
UNION ALL       -- Combines the values. 
INTERSECT       -- Displays only the intersection and duplicate values will be removed
INTERSECT ALL   -- Displays only the intersection and if each result-set contains duplicates they get displayed
EXCEPT          -- Display all the values of the first result set and remove all the intersection values. Removes duplicates 
EXCEPT ALL      -- Display all the values of the first result set and remove all the intersection values.
