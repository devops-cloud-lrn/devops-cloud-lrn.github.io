CREATE TABLE table-name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY 
    col2 INTEGER REFERENCES another-table(column-name) FOREIGN-KEY-CONSTRAINT
)

SERIAL          -- is to generate the integer automatically when ever a new record is being inserted into the table 
PRIMARY KEY     -- Creates a primary key index and constraint on the column id
REFERENCES      -- Creates a foreign key constraint and index on the column 'column-name' of the table 'another-table'

FOREIGN-KEY-CONSTRAINT: 
1. ON DELETE RESTRICT       - Default Option - Throws an error when the root row is deleted
2. ON DELETE NO ACTION      - Throws an error
3. ON DELETE CASCADE        - Deletes all the rows from the referencing table
4. ON DELETE SET NULL       - Updates with the NULL value
5. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT    - Updates with the default value set on the column

WHERE    - filters on set of rows
HAVING   - filters on set of groups  So HAVING will always be preceded with GROUP BY 

WHERE AND HAVING can be combined
Ex: SELECT A, B,C FROM TABLE1 WHERE CONDITION GROUP BY COLUMN HAVING CONDITION
